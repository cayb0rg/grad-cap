I graduated! This is something I put together really quickly the morning of graduation. I used [adavegetable](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=115535)'s code for scrolling the text and a web server (accessed by connecting to the access point) for changing the message. I was inspired by [James Bocinsky](https://www.jbocinsky.com/GraduationCap/).

Unfortunately, due to me being on a very tight schedule, I didn't get many photos or videos. However, here is a video of the cap when the text was still upside down.

And here is a photo of the cap being assembled. The ESP8266 was powered by a USB portable charger and sat just at the base of my neck.

I also goofed and had my cap rotated the wrong direction. They still gave me a degree, though, so it must have been alright!
